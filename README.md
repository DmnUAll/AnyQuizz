This project was the fourteenth app writen by myself.\
The main functionality that was applied in this project:
- JSON parsing
- CoreData
- DispatchQueue
- UINavigationController
- UIAlertController
- UITableView Delegate and Datasource methods
- Cells leading swipe actions
- UIActivityViewController
- UIActivityIndicatorView properties and methods

At some moment - the project was refactored to exclude a storyboard UI design.\
All UI is writen by code since then, but i saved my first project realisation into a separate branch, called ui_by_storyboard(before_refactoring).

Disclaimer:
The project was made for educational purposes only.
